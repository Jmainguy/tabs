# Nothing but the Blood

G             Em
What can wash away my sin?
G              C        D  G
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
G                Em
What can make me whole again?
G              C        D  G
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

   G      
   Oh, precious is the flow,
   D                      C
   That makes me white as snow;
   G        Em
   No other fount I know,
   G               C        D G
   Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

For my pardon this I see,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
For my cleansing this my plea,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Nothing can for sin atone,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Naught of good that I have done,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

This is all my hope and peace,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
This is all my righteousness,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
