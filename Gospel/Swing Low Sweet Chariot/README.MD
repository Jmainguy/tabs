```/bin/bash
        D        G      D
Swing low, sweet chariot,
                       A7
Comin' for to carry me home.
       D7        G      D
Swing low, sweet chariot,
               A7       D
Comin' for to carry me home.
 

     D                     G         D
I looked over Jordan, and what did I see,
                       A7
Comin' for to carry me home.
    D7                   G    D
A band of angels comin' after me,
               A7       D
Comin' for to carry me home.


       D           G       D
If you get there before I do,
                       A7
Comin' for to carry me home.
      D7                          G     D
Just tell my friends that I'm a comin' too.
               A7       D
Comin' for to carry me home.


    D                G         D
I'm sometimes up and sometimes down,
                       A7
Comin' for to carry me home.
    D7                   G       D
But still my soul feels heavenly bound.
               A7       D
Comin' for to carry me home.
