# Amazing Grace
## Guitar 1 (Rhythm)
```/bin/bash
DG      B5     A5   G    Em  D
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
     G       B5     A5   D
That saved a wretch like me.
D          G     D   Em     D
I once was lost, but now im found,
    G          B5  A5 G
Was blind, but now I  see.
```

## Guitar 2 (Lead)
This is the order of notes, but not the speed to play them at, spread it out so that it starts on Amazing Grace, and ends on but now I see, this

```/bin/bash
e|------------------------------------|
B|--0-0------0-0-3033030---------0-0--|
G|-0-0-20---0-0-2-------0--00---0-0-20|
D|0------200-------------02--200------|
A|------------------------------------|
E|------------------------------------|
