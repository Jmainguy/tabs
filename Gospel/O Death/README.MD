My name is death and I excel
      D                 C         A
I can open the gates to Heaven or Hell
A                        E
Cast a side the flesh of thee
D              C       A
Cast aside and set you free

A
Oh-oh Death
E
Oh-oh Death
          D                  C       A
Can't you spare me over till another year
